SkiFree? How About Monster Ski!
-------------------------------

As you may have guessed, it's a slight twist on to SkiFree's design. Instead of having a skier go down a hill and eventually getting eaten by a robotic yeti, you are the yeti and attempting to eat all the skiers. It's a fun twist, and if I get more time on my hands I may attempt to release a more interactive version to the App Store. I'll be beginning a tutorial on how to use Sprite Kit in the next week, but wanted to show the proof of concept to the world. 

If interested, take a look at the github while it still exists!
